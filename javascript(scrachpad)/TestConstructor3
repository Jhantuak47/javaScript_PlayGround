mechanic.increaseTirePresure = bicycle.increaseTirePresure;
//your next step would be go to console and type bicycle you will get increase bicycle works well...
//second step would be type mechanic.increaseTirePresure.call(bicycle)..
//again if you check bicycle you can see mechanic can also able to change the tire pressure...

//now the question is what is call method..
//to understand it refer to tutorial javascript for developer object and prototype....
